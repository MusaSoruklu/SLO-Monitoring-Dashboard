# SLO-Monitoring-Dashboard

The goal of this project is to combine knowledge of Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) with practical implementation by creating a comprehensive monitoring and alerting system for a web application.

The web application is a simple trading system that displays real-time stock data. A Python script is used to simulate random web server traffic. The system is designed to track key Service-Level Objectives (SLOs), such as response times and availability, ensuring that the web application operates within defined performance thresholds.

## 1. Installation and usage instructions

### Tools and dependencies:

- **Jenkins :** Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). It helps automate the building, testing, and deployment of applications. Documentation is available [here](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/)

- **Docker :** Docker is a platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerisation. Containers bundle an application and its dependencies into a lightweight unit that can run consistently across various environments. Documentation is available [here](https://docs.docker.com/)

- **Prometheus :** Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It is used to collect and store real-time metrics from the web application and system resources. Documentation is available [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/)

- **Grafana :** Grafana is an open-source analytics and monitoring platform that enables the creation of dynamic dashboards and visualisations. Documentation is available [here](https://grafana.com/docs/)
